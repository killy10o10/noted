# Noted (Front-End)

> Noted is a comprehensive task management tool with the ability to create, organize, and manage tasks. Users can add a task description, set a due date, assign a priority level, and track the status of each task. The app also includes a reminders feature to ensure that users do not forget to complete their tasks. Users can add notes to each task for additional information, categorize tasks with tags, break down large tasks into smaller subtasks, and attach relevant files or documents. Additionally, the recurrence feature allows users to set up recurring tasks that need to be completed on a regular basis. Noted has a backend of Node.js Express, EJS, JWT, and Sequelize with MySQL as the database.
